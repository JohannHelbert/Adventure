### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
